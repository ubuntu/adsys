  * Add mount / network shares policy manager
    - this is an Ubuntu Pro feature that allows mounting network shares at a
      user or machine level
    - supported mount types: smb, nfs, and ftp (after installing curlftpfs)
    - supported authentication: anonymous (default), krb5
    - user mounts are handled at login by a Rust binary now shipped with adsys
      Thanks to schopin for the packaging guidance and contributions
    - computer mounts are handled by systemd mount units requiring root
      privileges
  * Add AppArmor policy manager
    - this is an Ubuntu Pro feature that allows enforcing application
      confinement at a user or machine level using AppArmor
    - user policies rely on the libpam-apparmor package which must be
      installed manually
  * Support multiple AD backends and implement Winbind support
    - sssd is still the default backend, but winbind can be opted into through
      the adsys.yaml configuration file
  * Add a --machine / -m flag to adsysctl applied, indicating the policies
    applied to the current machine
  * Expose Ubuntu Pro status in the "status" command
    - status is now fetched dynamically instead of relying on a possibly
      outdated state when updating policies
  * Update scripts manager creation
    - scripts manager now creates both an users and machine directory on
      initialization
  * Fix policy update failing when GPT.INI contains no version key
  * Fix object lookup for users having a FQDN as their hostname
  * Support special characters in domains when parsing sssd configuration
  * Reduce dependencies by excluding CI tools from go.mod
    - tooling-related packages are now vendored in a separate go.mod file,
      allowing for a smaller source package
  * Replace gopkg.in/yaml.v2 with gopkg.in/yaml.v3
    Thanks to Juneezee for the contribution
  * Clean-up packaging scripts related to the user mount handler
    Thanks to liushuyu for the contribution
  * CI and quality of life changes not impacting package functionality:
    - Add golden functionality to testutils

    - Move adsysgpotests to golden generated by testutils
    - Fix test helper permission when making directory RO
    - Rework skipping integration tests

    - Refactor tracking and generating coverage files
    - Implement session dbus mock
    - Stabilize integration test coverage
    - Fix set-output GitHub Actions deprecation warning
    - Reuse our utility function for comparing trees
    - Install missing packages for auto-updates workflow
    - Update d/copyright to account for the new Rust dependencies
    - Fix FTBFS on Launchpad introduced by the latest unreleased work

  * Add Active Directory Watch Daemon - adwatchd: (LP: #1982351)
    - Implement a Windows daemon that watches a list of configured directories
      for changes and bumps the relevant GPT.INI files.
    - Add adsys-windows binary package which includes the Windows daemon

  * Rename chapters to be in correct ascii order when viewed online.
    Thanks to Anton Drastrup-Fjordbak.
  * Include 22.04 in admx/adml for lts only releases. (LP: #1973745)
  * Bump embedeed dependencies minor versions for both bug fixes and minor
    security enhancements.
  * Fix dconf keys not being readable by user after applying policy.
    (LP: #1973748)
  * Ensure we can execute machine and user scripts:
    /run is now noexec on Ubuntu. Ensure that we can execute the scripts in
    /run/adsys subdirectories. The scripts mechanism has been reviewed by the
    security team, so we can reset them as executable. (LP: #1973751)
  * Move integration tests under cmd/adsysd and admxgen binary to cmd/admxgen
    to prepare future adwatchd daemon under cmd/ which will be SRUed with an
    exception in next update. This is a no-op in the finale deploy binaries,
    apart from admxgen which is now using Cobra. This binary though is not
    shipped in any package and only used in CI.
  * Fix privilege permission which can not be set to disabled. (LP: #1973752)
  * Adaptation or new tests for all above changes.
  * Add fuzz tests and include new potential crash fixes on invalid files
    generated by Windows AD.
  * CI fixes and changes (not impacting finale package):
    - Move CI to Go 1.18 (package is already building with 1.18 in jammy).
    - Fixes due to new github.
    - Fix to generate all LTS releases in admx/adml (see above).

  * Change chown logic on script directory and parents to avoid potential
    vulnerability. (LP: #1961458)
  * Separate readiness from session running to avoid unrefreshed user script
    directories after a logout without any new logins.
  * pam_adsys: Fix memory leak and identation. (LP: #1961459)
  * Adapt to newer samba, while keeping backward compatilibity for CI.
    Thanks Michael. (LP: #1962170)
  * Try to stabilize configuration detection change test by calling sync() to
    sync FHS to disk, and then, hoping we get the inotify update. Seems to fix
    flakyness on armhf. (LP: #1962510)
  * Enforce closing stderr on ppcel64 in tests with new samba to avoid hangs
    in race.
  * Fix linting issues discovered by new golangci-lint.

  [ Jean-Baptiste Lallement ]
  [ Didier Roche ]
  * Add new types of GPOs support, with ubuntu advantage subscription
    integration. Recommends ubuntu-advantage-desktop-daemon.
  * Privilege escalation: support for privilege escalation and gives
    administrator access to users and groups registered in Active Directory.
    The administrator can also prevent any kind of local administrator on
    the machine.
  * Scripts integration: support for scripts in GPO when the computer boots and
    shuts down, and when the user logs on or off.
    - The computer scripts are ran as root, on startup (or first AD user login
      if we couldn’t fetch GPOs and had no cache)
    - The user scripts are ran with systemd user session, as the user.
    - A transactional state is handled: New versions of scripts or list of
      scripts are only updated when a given session is not opened.
      Said differently, the shutdown scripts for the machine will be the ones
      downloaded and enabled when the start scripts were ran.
      Similarly, the user logoff scripts will be the ones corresponding to
      the time when the log on scripts were executed.
    - Any failing scripts won’t stop the boot or log on. Similarly to Windows
      script support, this is not a security feature.
  * Support downloading assets from the Active Directory server. Those assets
    are located in the <Distribution> named directory at SYSVOL root.
    Those needs a GPT.INI, similarly to GPO, to control cache update.
  * Internal changes on how policies and cached are handled. Those changes are
    needed to enhance the model of caching with assets, while keeping
    a transactional behaviour.
  * Many new tests covering all the new and existing changes.
  * General cleanups:
    - More debugging and info messages.
    - In templates, policies define personalized notes and descriptions.
      Those are now used to generate the description of the policy.
    - Modernize, fix bugs and workarounds now that we are on at min Go 1.16,
      and prepare for 1.17 and new vendored dependencies versions.
    - Add more linting support and fix discovered issues.
    - Rewrite integration tests containers mimicking system services in python
      for better reliability and support via dbus-mock. Upgraded to a newer
      version.
    - Adapt to new GitHub infrastructure changes with new container repository,
      and change workflows adjustements by new linting rules.
    - Discare deprecated dconf keys for those releases.
  * Updated vendored go dependencies:
    - bluemonday
    - cobra
    - color
    - glamour
    - go-dbus
    - golangci-lint
    - grpc
    - ini
    - viper

adsys (0.7.1) impish; urgency=medium

    of entry is given
  * Fix pam module to always be loaded for those.
  * All users and machine update should not provide a target

    mode.

      a broken libc.
  * Packaging fixes:
    - Ensure we always build with PIE
    - Fix autopkgtests by not running them as root
    - Ship NOTICE from a vendor dependency as being Apache2 licensed
