    Define network shares that will be mounted for the client.
    If more shares are defined higher the GPO hierarchy, the entries listed here will be appended to the list and duplicates will be removed.

    Values should be in the format: 
        <protocol>://<hostname-or-ip>/<shared-dir>
    e.g.
        nfs://example_nfs.com/nfs_shared_dir
        smb://example_smb.com/smb_shared_dir
        ftp://example_ftp.com/ftp_shared_dir
    
    This pattern must be followed, otherwise the policy will not be applied.
    
    By the default, the mounts will be done in anonymous mode. In case of authentication needed, a krb5 tag can be added to the value, e.g.
        [krb5]<protocol>://<hostname-or-ip>/<shared-dir>

    If the tag is added, the mount will require Kerberos authentication in order to occur.

    The supported protocols are the same as the ones supported by gvfs.
    They are listed on the man page of gvfs, under the gvfs-backends section: https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/jammy/en/man7/gvfs.7.html
