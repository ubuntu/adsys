- key: "/user-mounts"
  displayname: "Mount points for the client"
  explaintext: |
    Define mount points that will be mounted for the client.
    We will add one mount per line, the order of the mounts will be according to the order the mount points were listed in the policy, removing duplicates.
    The mounts listed will be appended to the list of mounts referenced higher in the GPO hierarchy.
    Anonymous and Kerberos validated mounts will be handled automatically.

    Values should be in the format: 
            protocol://<hostname-or-ip>/mountpath 
    
    And anonymous mounts should have a prefix tag [anonymous] to indicate them, e.g:
            [anonymous]protocol://<hostname-or-ip>/mountpath
    
  elementtype: "multiText"
  release: "any"
  type: "mount"

- key: "/system-mounts"
  displayname: "System mounts"
  explaintext: |
    Define network shares that will be mounted for the system.
    If more shares are defined higher in other GPO, the entries listed here will be appended to the list and duplicates will be removed.
    
    Values should be in the format: <protocol>://<hostname-or-ip>/shared-dir.
    Examples:
      nfs://example.com/nfs_share
      smb://example.com/smb_share
      ftp://example.com/ftp_share

    Anonymous mounts should be prefixed by the [anonymous] tag:
      [anonymous]<protocol>://<hostname-or-ip>/shared-dir

    The supported protocols are the same as the ones supported by gvfs. They are listed under the gvfs-backends section on https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/jammy/en/man7/gvfs.7.html
