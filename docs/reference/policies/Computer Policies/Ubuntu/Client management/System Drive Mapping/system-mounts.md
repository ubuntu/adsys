# System mounts

Define network shares that will be mounted for the system.
If more shares are defined higher in the GPO hierarchy, the entries listed here will be appended to the list and duplicates will be removed.

Values should be in the format: 
    <protocol>://<hostname-or-ip>/<shared-dir>
e.g.
    nfs://example_nfs.com/nfs_shared_dir
    smb://example_smb.com/smb_shared_dir
    ftp://ftp_share_server.com

This pattern must be followed, otherwise the policy will not be applied.

By default, the mounts will be done in anonymous mode. In case of authentication needed, a krb5 tag can be added to the value, e.g.
    `[krb5]`<protocol>://<hostname-or-ip>/<shared-dir>

If the tag is added, the mount will require Kerberos authentication in order to occur.

The supported protocols / filsystems are the same as the ones supported by the mount command.
They are listed on the mount man page on https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/mount.8.html
It's up to the user to ensure that the requested protocols are valid and supported and that the shared directories have the correct configuration for the requested connection.
