# Auto-configuration URL

Declare system-wide proxy auto-configuration URL.

Auto-configuration URLs are always prioritized over manual proxy settings, meaning that if all proxy options are set, the GPO client will enable automatic proxy configuration for supported backends. An empty value will remove previously set settings of the same type.


- Type: proxy
- Key: /proxy/auto

Note: -
 * Enabled: The setting in the text entry is applied on the client machine.
 * Disabled: The setting is removed from the target machine.
 * Not configured: A setting declared higher in the GPO hierarchy will be used if available.


Supported on Ubuntu 22.04, 24.04, 25.04, 25.10.

An Ubuntu Pro subscription on the client is required to apply this policy.
