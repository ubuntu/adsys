# Managing AppArmor profiles

The AppArmor manager allows to enforce custom [AppArmor](https://apparmor.net/) profiles on the client.

Custom AppArmor profiles can be enforced on a:

* System-wide level, located in `Computer Configuration > Policies > Administrative Templates > Ubuntu > Client management > System-wide application confinement > AppArmor`
* User level, located in `Computer Configuration > Policies > Administrative Templates > Ubuntu > Session management > User application confinement > AppArmor`

## Feature availability

This feature is available only for the subscribers of the **Ubuntu Advantage** offer.

## Rules precedence

On a system-wide level, files in the entry are appended to the list of profiles referenced higher in the GPO hierarchy.

On a user level, the configured profile will override any profile referenced higher in the GPO hierarchy.

## Installing AppArmor profiles on sysvol

AppArmor profiles must be available in the assets sharing directory on your Active Directory `sysvol/` samba share.

In this directory, next to `Policies` in your domain folder, create a directory matching your distribution name. For instance `Ubuntu`, which will be the assets sharing directory.

It must also contain a `GPT.ini` file of the form:

```ini
[General]
Version=22
displayName=Ubuntu Assets Directory
```

Every time you change the contents of AppArmor profiles, you need to increase the version stanza in the `GPT.ini` file (similarly to how Active Directory is doing automatically when you change any field). This will signal clients that a new version of assets (including AppArmor profiles) are available and should be downloaded.

Then, place any AppArmor profiles you need under the `apparmor/` directory (subdirectories are allowed).

### Automating the incrementation of the `GPT.ini` version stanza

Making manual changes to a file everytime AppArmor profiles are changed can be unproductive and tedious. For your convenience, we developed a tool to automate this process. For detailed usage and installation instructions please refer to the [Active Directory Watch Daemon](12.-Active-Directory-Watch-Daemon.md) documentation.

## Developing AppArmor profiles

We highly recommend developing AppArmor profiles separately from ADSys, testing them, and only then integrating them with ADSys. Here are some resources to get you started:

- https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/beginning-apparmor-profile-development#1-overview
- https://gitlab.com/apparmor/apparmor/-/wikis/Documentation
- https://medium.com/information-and-technology/so-what-is-apparmor-64d7ae211ed

## System-wide profiles

The form is a list of AppArmor profile paths, relative to the `apparmor/` subdirectory of your assets sharing filesystem, one per line.

![List of machine profiles example](images/Managing-AppArmor-profiles/apparmor-machine-ui.png)

When set to enabled, adsys will load the configured AppArmor profiles on refresh. AppArmor's caching functionality is leveraged to ensure redundant reloads are kept to a minimum, i.e. a loaded profile will be reparsed only if a change occurred in the profile definition.

On the client machine, system-wide profiles are located under `/etc/apparmor.d/adsys/machine` by default.

When set disabled / not configured, ADSys will unload any previously loaded profiles (that were managed by ADSys) from the client machine.

## User profiles

AppArmor supports confining executables on a user-by-user basis via the [`pam_apparmor` PAM module](https://gitlab.com/apparmor/apparmor/-/wikis/Pam_apparmor). The module allows applications to confine authenticated users into subprofiles based on group names, user names, or a default profile. To accomplish this, `pam_apparmor` needs to be registered as a PAM session module. A [working example](https://gitlab.com/apparmor/apparmor/-/wikis/Pam_apparmor_example) can be found on the official AppArmor repository wiki.

The form accepts a path to a single file, relative to the `apparmor/` directory of your assets sharing filesystem.

### Installing the AppArmor PAM module

The PAM module can be installed on Ubuntu using the following command:
```
sudo apt install libpam-apparmor
```

The module must then be configured manually for any desired executables. To enable it for the `su` command, append the following to the `/etc/pam.d/su` file:

```
session optional pam_apparmor.so order=user,default
```

> **Warning**
> Even though GPOs can be applied to AD groups, the AppArmor policy manager currently only supports confining AD users, so we've omitted `group` from the PAM order.

### User profile declaration syntax

As per the example linked above, the user profile is essentially a subprofile (also known as a *hat*) which needs to be included in the actual executable profile definition. The PAM module will then attempt to change *hats* into a subprofile containing the target user's name.

If a regular subprofile looks like the following (assuming `admin@domain.com` is the user we want to confine):

```apparmor
^admin@domain.com {
  #include <abstractions/authentication>
  #include <abstractions/nameservice>
  capability dac_override,
  capability setgid,
  capability setuid,
  /etc/default/su r,
  /etc/environment r,
  @{HOMEDIRS}/.xauth* w,
  /bin/{,b,d,rb}ash Ux,
  /bin/{c,k,tc}sh Ux,
}
```

Its ADSys counterpart will omit the first and last lines which will be inferred automatically when policies are applied on the client machine. Thus, the subprofile declaration becomes:

```apparmor
#include <abstractions/authentication>
#include <abstractions/nameservice>
capability dac_override,
capability setgid,
capability setuid,
/etc/default/su r,
/etc/environment r,
@{HOMEDIRS}/.xauth* w,
/bin/{,b,d,rb}ash Ux,
/bin/{c,k,tc}sh Ux,
```

When the policy is applied on the target machine, the user profile will be created in `/etc/apparmor.d/adsys/users/admin@domain.com`.

The user profile doesn't accomplish anything on its own until it is included in a system-wide profile definition. We recommend including the entire `users` directory in the profile declaration, as evidenced by the official `pam_apparmor` documentation.

It is also recommended to define a `DEFAULT` subprofile as part of the system-wide profiles to ensure `pam_apparmor` has a profile to switch to as a last resort if it cannot find a profile for the user.

```apparmor
/usr/bin/su {
  ...
  include "users"

  ^DEFAULT {
     capability dac_override,
     capability setgid,
     capability setuid,
     /etc/default/su r,
     /etc/environment r,
     @{HOMEDIRS}/.xauth* w,
     /usr/bin/{,b,d,rb}ash Px -> default_user,
     /usr/bin/{c,k,tc}sh Px -> default_user,
   }
}
```

## Profile parsing behaviours

### Troubleshooting misbehaving user profiles

If you encounter issues with user profiles, it's always helpful to check the kernel buffer (`dmesg`) and the authentication logs at `/var/log/auth.log`. Additionally, appending `debug` to the PAM module declaration stanzas at `/etc/pam.d/` will log additional debug information, such as the profile that the module tries to switch to.

```
Nov 18 13:55:48 ubuntu2204 su: pam_unix(su:session): session opened for user administrator@warthogs.biz(uid=1130200500) by root(uid=0)
Nov 18 13:55:48 ubuntu2204 su: pam_apparmor(su:session): Using username 'administrator@warthogs.biz'
```

In contrast, switching to a user with no declared profile and no default profile will print the following and restrict access entirely:

```
Nov 18 14:00:22 ubuntu2204 su: pam_unix(su:session): session opened for user fry@warthogs.biz(uid=1130201105) by root(uid=0)
Nov 18 14:00:22 ubuntu2204 su: pam_apparmor(su:session): Using username 'fry@warthogs.biz'
Nov 18 14:00:22 ubuntu2204 su: pam_apparmor(su:session): Using DEFAULT
Nov 18 14:00:22 ubuntu2204 su: pam_apparmor(su:session): Can't change to any hat
Nov 18 14:00:22 ubuntu2204 su: pam_unix(su:session): session closed for user fry@warthogs.biz
```

The PAM module goes through the order specified in the configuration (user, default), ultimately bailing and denying access if it cannot find any hat to switch to.

### Error on loading profiles

ADSys relies on the `apparmor_parser` executable to parse, load, and unload profiles. If the command fails for any reason (e.g. syntax errors in profile declaration), loading profiles will be aborted and the output of the `apparmor_parser` command will be logged.

```
ERROR Error from server: error while updating policy: failed to apply policy to "ubuntu2204": can't apply apparmor policy to ubuntu2204: can't apply machine policy: failed to get apparmor policies: exit status 1
AppArmor parser error for /etc/apparmor.d/adsys/machine/pam_roles in profile /etc/apparmor.d/adsys/machine/pam_roles at line 9: Lexer found unexpected character: '<' (0x3c) in state: INITIAL 
```

### Invalid profile path reference

If an AppArmor profile referenced by a GPO doesn't exist or the path is incorrect, then the policy will fail to be applied and any client startup or user log on will fail.
